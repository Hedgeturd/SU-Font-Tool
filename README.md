## Thanks
Big thank you to [TheExentist151](https://github.com/TheExentist151) for letting me recycle some of the code from [SonicColorsXTBConv](https://github.com/TheExentist151/SonicColorsXTBConv)<br>
Plus a thank you to [NextinHKRY](https://github.com/NextinMono) for general coding help

## Requirements
If the tool does nothing when used, you may need to install the [.NET Runtime](https://aka.ms/dotnet-core-applaunch?missing_runtime=true&arch=x64&rid=win10-x64&apphost_version=8.0) package that the tool needs to work
